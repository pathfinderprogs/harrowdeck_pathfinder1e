# Harrow Deck (Pathfinder 1e)
## Purpose
This program is designed to draw a card from the harrow deck. This is helpful for content that involves using harrow cards, such as class features for Cartomancer, Card Caster, or Harrow Chosen characters. This program currently draws one card at a time.

## Future Plans
Cleanup code, make a GUI App for ease of use with images.
